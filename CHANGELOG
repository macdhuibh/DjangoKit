2008-11-05 (development)

  * Added an 'apps' key to setup.py, allowing multiple apps to be packaged up
  * This has broken the current behaviour! The default urls.py file puts apps
    at /<appname>/ rather than a single app at '/', so the root page, and thus 
    the start page, of your app will now be an ERROR PAGE! Bad thing.

2007-04-13 Installable

  * Made installable
  * Added Wiki example
  * Made source shippable
  * Added setup.py wrapper

2007-03-28 First public release

  * It works. I won't give it a lot more than that.
